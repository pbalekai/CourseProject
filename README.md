Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Overview: This project demonstrates the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. 

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The source data for this project can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Modifying the script: Once you have extracted the source files, you will need to make a modification to the R file before you can process the data. Please make sure to set the working directory to the correct path in your local machine.

Project Summary: Create an R script run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Additional Information: You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
